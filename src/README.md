# Development

To develop, a python3 virtual environment is recommended to install any dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To add any dependencies to the project, install them with `pip` add them to `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
